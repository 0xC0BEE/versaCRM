This document outlines the next strategic evolution of the VersaCRM platform, building upon our completed foundational plan. The goal is to establish a dominant market position by focusing on four key pillars: Collaboration, Advanced Intelligence, Commerce, and Deep Verticalization.

## Pillar 2 - Phase 13: The Intelligence Layer 2.0

-   [x] **Automated Data Hygiene:**
    -   [x] Implement an AI-powered process that scans for duplicate contacts and suggests merges.

## Pillar 4 - Phase 15: Deep Verticalization

**Goal:** Go beyond our current industry templates and build deep, specialized "Cloud" solutions with unique data models, workflows, and compliance features, mirroring the successful strategy of Salesforce.
