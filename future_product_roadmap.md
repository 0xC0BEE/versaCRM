## Pillar 2 - The Intelligence Layer 2.0 (Complete)

-   [x] **Conversational BI (Business Intelligence):** Enhance the Growth Co-pilot to understand natural language queries about data and generate charts/reports on the fly (e.g., "Show me our top 5 deals this quarter").

## Pillar 6 - Onboarding & Guidance 2.0 (Next Up)

-   [ ] **AI-Powered "5-Minute CRM":** An intelligent onboarding interview where users can opt to answer a detailed questionnaire about their business, sales process, marketing efforts, and customer support flows. The AI will use these answers to automatically:
    -   Configure deal stages.
    -   Create relevant custom objects and fields.
    -   Draft a "Welcome" email template.
    -   Set up a basic lead capture form.
    -   Build a simple lead nurturing campaign journey.
-   [ ] **Proactive AI Feature Onboarding:** Following the setup, present a summary of recommended AI features (e.g., Deal Forecasting, Churn Prediction, AI Reply Suggestions) based on the user's industry and goals. Allow one-click activation of these features, with a clear link to manage them later in Settings.
-   [ ] **Interactive Guided Tours:** Role-based product tours (Admin vs. Team Member) that guide users through key workflows, such as creating their first deal, resolving a ticket, or building a custom report.
-   [ ] **Personalized AI Tips Engine:**
    -   An AI agent that observes individual user habits and patterns (e.g., frequently filtering contacts by the same criteria, manually sending similar emails).
    -   Proactively suggest creating time-saving assets like a saved "Audience Profile," a new workflow, or a "Canned Response" based on these observed habits.
    -   Include a global setting for users to enable or disable these predictive tips.
