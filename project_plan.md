# VersaCRM Project Plan & Strategic Roadmap

## 1. Project Status & Current Capabilities (What We've Built)

This section details the current state of the VersaCRM application, a robust, multi-tenant, and industry-aware CRM foundation.

### Core Architecture
- **Framework:** Single Page Application (SPA) built with React 18 and TypeScript.
- **State Management:** A suite of React Context providers for managing global state (`App`, `Auth`, `Theme`, `Data`, `Notifications`).
- **Data Fetching:** Asynchronous operations and server-state caching are handled by `@tanstack/react-query`.
- **Styling:** A flexible and responsive UI built with Tailwind CSS, featuring a dynamic theming system (light, dark, and a custom theme builder).
- **Backend:** A mocked API client (`apiClient.ts`) that simulates network latency and data persistence within the session, enabling rapid frontend development.
- **Testing:** A solid testing foundation is established using Vitest and React Testing Library.

### Key Implemented Features

#### **A. Authentication & Security**
- **Granular Permissions:** A full-fledged Roles & Permissions system allowing admins to create custom roles and define specific permissions (e.g., `contacts:read:all`, `deals:create`, `settings:manage:team`).
- **Dedicated Consoles:** Each role receives a unique console or portal, with UI elements dynamically rendered based on their permissions.
- **Organization Scoping:** Data is properly scoped, so users only see data relevant to their organization and role.

#### **B. Industry Specialization & Customization**
- **Dynamic Industry Configuration:** The CRM adapts its terminology, fields, and dashboard components based on the selected industry (`Health`, `Finance`, `Legal`, `Generic`).
- **Custom Field Builder:** A user-friendly interface in the Settings for admins to add, edit, and delete custom fields for the `Contacts` module.
- **Custom Theme Builder:** Users can create, save, and apply their own color schemes.

#### **C. Core CRM & Sales Modules**
- **Contacts Management:** Full CRUD functionality for contacts. A comprehensive 360-degree detail view with multiple tabs (Profile, History, Orders, etc.). Includes advanced features like bulk actions, filtering, and click-to-call.
- **Deals Pipeline:** A visual, Kanban-style board for sales pipeline management with drag-and-drop functionality.
- **Task Management:** A dedicated "My Tasks" page for managing to-do lists.
- **Calendar & Scheduling:** A full-page calendar for creating and viewing events.

#### **D. Marketing & Automation**
- **Visual Journey Builder:** An advanced, node-based visual editor for creating multi-step marketing campaigns with branching logic (e.g., "If email opened...").
- **Workflow Automation:** A powerful engine for both simple ("if this, then that") and advanced visual workflows, triggered by events across Contacts, Deals, and Tickets.
- **Lead Scoring:** A configurable engine to automatically score leads based on interactions and status changes, fully integrated into campaigns and workflows.
- **Campaign Performance Analytics:** A dedicated reporting page for each campaign, showing KPIs, a conversion funnel, an engagement timeline, and lists of engaged contacts.

#### **E. Service & Communication**
- **Support Ticketing System:** A complete ticketing module with threaded replies, internal notes with `@mentions`, file attachments, and SLA timers.
- **Live Chat Widget:** A customizable chat widget that can be embedded on external websites to capture leads and create support tickets automatically.
- **Two-Way Email Sync:** A simulated integration to connect a user's email inbox, automatically logging communications on the correct contact's record.
- **VoIP Telephony Integration:** A simulated "click-to-call" feature with an in-app call control modal and automatic call logging, including an AI-powered call summary feature.

#### **F. Analytics & Reporting**
- **Custom Report Builder:** A powerful tool allowing admins to build and save custom tabular or graphical reports with a live preview, supporting various data sources, filters, and aggregations.
- **Customizable Dashboard:** Admins can add their saved custom reports as widgets to their main dashboard for at-a-glance insights.

#### **G. Platform & Extensibility**
- **API & App Marketplace Foundation:** A dedicated settings area for managing API keys and a simulated App Marketplace. A full API documentation page is also available, laying the groundwork for a developer ecosystem.
- **Data Migration Tool:** A functional CSV import/export tool for contacts, including a field-mapping step to ensure data integrity.

## 2. Strategic Analysis & Next Major Phase

A competitive analysis against top-tier CRMs (Salesforce, HubSpot, Zoho) reveals that while VersaCRM has an exceptionally strong internal engine for automation and analytics, it lacks the native tools to **proactively generate and capture leads from a company's public-facing digital assets.**

This is the most significant strategic gap. To truly compete as an all-in-one "Growth Platform," we must bridge the gap between a user's website and the CRM.

Therefore, our next major development phase will be the creation of the **Inbound Marketing & Lead Capture Suite**.

## 3. Strategic Roadmap: Building a True Growth Platform

To elevate VersaCRM to the level of market leaders, we will focus on these key pillars, starting with the highest priority.

### **Pillar 1: Inbound Marketing & Lead Capture Suite (Highest Priority)**
This suite transforms the CRM from a passive database into a proactive growth engine.
- **Public Form Builder:** Build a tool for creating custom forms (with custom fields) that can be embedded on external websites to capture leads directly into VersaCRM.
- **Landing Page Builder:** Create a simple, component-based builder for creating and hosting marketing landing pages, complete with the forms created in the Form Builder.
- **Website Analytics Integration:** Provide a tracking script to link anonymous website visitor activity (page views, sessions) to a contact's profile after they convert on a form, providing invaluable context for sales.

### **Pillar 2: Platform Extensibility & True Customization**
This pillar focuses on evolving VersaCRM from a product into a true platform.
- **Live Public API:** Transition the simulated API to a live, production-ready backend with a real database, enabling a true third-party developer ecosystem.
- **Custom Objects:** This is a major architectural step. Allow admins to define, create, and manage brand new top-level objects beyond Contacts and Deals (e.g., "Properties" for a real estate CRM, or "Contracts" for a legal firm).
- **App Marketplace Expansion:** Build out the backend infrastructure to support real, third-party app integrations (e.g., QuickBooks for accounting, Slack for notifications).

### **Pillar 3: Predictive Intelligence & Advanced BI**
- **Predictive Analytics (AI):**
    - **Deal Forecasting:** Use historical data to predict the probability of a deal closing.
    - **Churn Prediction:** Analyze behavior to identify customers at risk of churning.
    - **Next Best Action:** Recommend the next best action for a sales or support rep.
- **Advanced Dashboard Canvas:** Evolve the dashboard to a full drag-and-drop canvas where users can freely resize, rearrange, and configure a wide variety of charts and data visualizations.

### **Pillar 4: Enterprise-Grade Platform Features**
- **Native Mobile Applications:** Develop full-featured native iOS and Android applications with offline capabilities.
- **Sandbox Environments:** Provide isolated sandbox environments for testing new configurations, workflows, and integrations without affecting production data.
