# VersaCRM Project Plan & Strategic Roadmap

## 1. Project Status & Current Capabilities (What We've Built)

This section details the current state of the VersaCRM application, a robust, multi-tenant, and industry-aware CRM foundation.

### Core Architecture
- **Framework:** Single Page Application (SPA) built with React 18 and TypeScript.
- **State Management:** A suite of React Context providers for managing global state (`App`, `Auth`, `Theme`, `Data`, `Notifications`).
- **Data Fetching:** Asynchronous operations and server-state caching are handled by `@tanstack/react-query`.
- **Styling:** A flexible and responsive UI built with Tailwind CSS, featuring a dynamic theming system (light, dark, and a custom theme builder).
- **Backend:** A mocked API client (`apiClient.ts`) that simulates network latency and data persistence within the session, enabling rapid frontend development.
- **Testing:** A solid testing foundation is established using Vitest and React Testing Library, with initial tests for UI components and core utilities.

### Key Implemented Features

#### **A. Authentication & Multi-Tenancy**
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Four distinct user roles (`Super Admin`, `Organization Admin`, `Team Member`, `Client`) with tailored UI and permissions.
- **Dedicated Consoles:** Each role receives a unique console or portal, ensuring a focused user experience.
- **Organization Scoping:** Data is properly scoped, so Organization Admins and Team Members only see data relevant to their organization.
- **Super Admin View:** A dedicated page for Super Admins to oversee and manage all organizations on the platform.

#### **B. Industry Specialization & Customization**
- **Dynamic Industry Configuration:** The CRM adapts its terminology, fields, and dashboard components based on the selected industry (`Health`, `Finance`, `Legal`, `Generic`).
- **Custom Field Builder:** A user-friendly interface in the Settings for admins to add, edit, and delete custom fields for the `Contacts` module, specific to their industry.
- **Custom Theme Builder:** Users can create, save, and apply their own color schemes to personalize the application's appearance.

#### **C. Core CRM Modules**
- **Contacts Management:** Full CRUD functionality for contacts. A comprehensive detail view provides a 360-degree look at a contact through various tabs (Profile, Interaction History, Orders, Documents, etc.). Includes advanced features like bulk actions and filtering.
- **Deals Pipeline:** A visual, Kanban-style board for sales pipeline management. Users can drag and drop deals between stages to update their status.
- **Support Ticketing System:** A complete ticketing module where users and clients can create tickets. Features include threaded replies, internal notes with `@mentions`, file attachments, and SLA timers to track response/resolution times.
- **Task Management:** A dedicated "My Tasks" page allows users to manage their to-do lists, with features for marking tasks complete and viewing overdue items.
- **Calendar & Scheduling:** A full-page calendar for creating and viewing events.

#### **D. AI & User Experience**
- **AI-Powered Features (Gemini):**
    - **Smart Search:** A `Ctrl+K` modal that uses natural language processing to either apply complex filters or generate text-based reports.
    - **AI Insights:** A dashboard widget that analyzes key metrics and provides actionable summaries.
    - **AI Email Composer:** An assistant in the contact detail view to draft professional emails from a simple prompt.
    - **AI Contact Summary:** Generates a concise summary of a contact's history and status.
    - **Client-Facing AI Assistant:** A chatbot in the Client Portal for answering questions.
- **Notifications Center:** A real-time, in-app panel that alerts users to new assignments, mentions, and ticket replies.
- **Client Portal:** A secure, self-service portal for clients to view their profile, interaction history, shared documents, and manage their support tickets.

#### **E. Reporting & Analytics**
- **Standard Reports:** Pre-built, filterable reports for key areas like Deals, Sales, Inventory, and Team Performance.
- **Custom Report Builder:** A powerful tool allowing admins to build and save custom tabular or graphical reports by selecting a data source, columns, filters, and visualization type (table, bar, pie, line).
- **Customizable Dashboard:** Admins can add their saved custom reports as widgets to their main dashboard for at-a-glance insights.

## 2. Immediate Next Steps (What We've Planned)

This section outlines features that are designed but require further implementation.

- **Full Workflow Automation:** The `WorkflowBuilder` UI is complete, but the `workflowService` needs to be triggered by more events (e.g., Deal stage change, Ticket creation). We also need to expand the library of available triggers and actions.
- **Campaign Execution Engine:** The `CampaignBuilder` allows users to design email sequences. The backend logic to execute these campaigns (i.e., send emails based on the defined schedule and track open/click rates) needs to be built.
- **Scoped Data Views:** Implement the logic to ensure "Team Members" can only see contacts, deals, and tasks that are explicitly assigned to them.
- **Data Migration Tool:** The UI for data import/export exists as a placeholder. This needs to be built out with robust CSV parsing, field mapping, and error handling.
- **Expand Test Coverage:** Increase the number of unit and integration tests to cover complex user flows, mutations, and all AI-powered features.

## 3. Strategic Roadmap: Competing with Top 5 CRMs

To elevate VersaCRM to the level of market leaders like Salesforce, HubSpot, and Zoho, we will focus on three key pillars: **Automation**, **Integration**, and **Intelligence**.

### **Pillar 1: Advanced Automation & Marketing**
- **Lead Scoring:** Develop a system to automatically score leads based on demographics, custom field data, and engagement (e.g., +10 points for opening an email, +25 for visiting the pricing page).
- **Visual Journey Builder:** Evolve the Campaign Builder into a full-fledged visual workflow editor with branching logic (e.g., "If lead score > 50, create a deal and assign it to a sales rep; else, add to a nurturing sequence").
- **Website & Social Media Integration:**
    - Provide a tracking script for websites to capture visitor analytics and link sessions to CRM contacts.
    - Integrate with social media platforms (LinkedIn, Twitter) to schedule posts and monitor brand mentions directly from the CRM.

### **Pillar 2: Seamless Integration & Extensibility**
- **Public API & App Marketplace:**
    - Design and document a secure, public REST or GraphQL API for third-party developers.
    - Build an App Marketplace where other SaaS companies can list integrations (e.g., QuickBooks for accounting, Slack for notifications, Shopify for e-commerce).
- **Native Communication Integrations:**
    - **Email Sync:** Deep two-way synchronization with Google Workspace and Microsoft 365, allowing users to manage their CRM activities from their inbox.
    - **VoIP Telephony:** Integrate a VoIP dialer to enable click-to-call from contact profiles, with automatic call logging, recording, and AI-powered transcription.
- **Live Chat Widget:** Provide a customizable live chat widget that businesses can embed on their website, with conversations automatically creating new leads or support tickets.

### **Pillar 3: Predictive Intelligence & Advanced BI**
- **Predictive Analytics (AI):**
    - **Deal Forecasting:** Use historical data to predict the probability of a deal closing and forecast future revenue.
    - **Churn Prediction:** Analyze contact behavior to identify customers at risk of churning, allowing for proactive intervention.
    - **Next Best Action:** Recommend the next best action for a sales or support rep to take with a specific contact.
- **Fully Customizable Dashboards:** Move beyond widgets to a drag-and-drop dashboard canvas where users can freely resize, rearrange, and configure a wide variety of charts, tables, and funnels.
- **Enterprise BI Connectors:** Allow large organizations to connect their data warehouses and dedicated BI tools (Tableau, Power BI) directly to their VersaCRM data for advanced analysis.

### **Pillar 4: Enterprise-Grade Platform Features**
- **Granular Permissions:** Evolve beyond role-based permissions to a fully granular system allowing admins to control field-level visibility and access rights for different teams.
- **Sandbox Environments:** Provide isolated sandbox environments for testing new configurations, workflows, and integrations without affecting the live production data.
- **Native Mobile Applications:** Develop full-featured native iOS and Android applications with offline capabilities, enabling teams to work effectively from anywhere.
