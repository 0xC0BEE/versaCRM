                <p>
                    VersaCRM's user interface is built upon a modern, consistent, and accessible design system. Our approach is heavily inspired by the principles of industry-leading component libraries like <strong>shadcn/ui</strong>.
                </p>
                <h3 id="core-principles">Core Principles</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Composability:</strong> Our UI components (Buttons, Cards, Modals, etc.) are built as small, reusable blocks. This allows us to construct complex layouts with consistency and flexibility. For example, a <code>Card</code> is composed of <code>CardHeader</code>, <code>CardContent</code>, and <code>CardFooter</code>, giving developers fine-grained control over its structure.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Accessibility (A11y):</strong> We prioritize making the application usable for everyone. This includes proper use of ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and sufficient color contrast.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Theming with CSS Variables:</strong> The entire application's color scheme is controlled by a set of CSS variables. This allows for seamless switching between Light and Dark modes and enables the powerful Custom Theme Builder, which lets you define your own brand colors.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p className="mt-4">
                    By not being tied to a specific third-party component library and instead adopting these principles, we maintain full control over the look, feel, and performance of the application, ensuring a world-class user experience.

                    Sandbox Environments are safe, isolated copies of your production environment. They are an essential tool for enterprise-grade CRM management, allowing you to test changes, train users, and validate configurations without any risk to your live business data.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Create a Sandbox:</strong> Navigate to <strong>Settings &gt; Developer & Data</strong>. In the "Sandboxes" section, give your new sandbox a name and click "Create Sandbox". This will create a full copy of your current production data and settings.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Switch Environments:</strong> A new environment switcher dropdown will appear in the main header, next to your profile name. Use this to switch between your "Production" environment and any sandboxes you've created.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Work in the Sandbox:</strong> When you switch to a sandbox, a prominent banner will appear at the top of the application, reminding you that you are in a safe testing environment. You can now make any changes you wantâ€”create test contacts, modify workflows, build new custom objectsâ€”without affecting your real data.
                    </li>
                     <li>
                        <strong>Refresh a Sandbox:</strong> In the Sandbox settings, click the "Refresh" button next to a sandbox. This will completely overwrite the sandbox with a fresh copy of your current production data. This is useful for starting a new round of testing.
                    </li>
                     <li>
                        <strong>Delete a Sandbox:</strong> Click the "Delete" button to permanently remove a sandbox environment you no longer need.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Switch Back to Production:</strong> When you're done testing, simply use the environment switcher to return to "Production". All your live data will be exactly as you left it.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p className="mt-4">
                    <strong>Note:</strong> Changes made in a sandbox are not automatically moved to production. You must manually replicate any successful changes (like a new workflow) in your production environment.
