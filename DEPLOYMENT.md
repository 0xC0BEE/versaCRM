# Deployment Pipeline (CI/CD) Strategy

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) strategy for VersaCRM. CI/CD is an automated process that takes new code, tests it, builds it, and deploys it, ensuring a fast, reliable, and consistent release cycle.

Our pipeline is designed to:
- **Ensure Code Quality:** Automatically run tests on every change.
- **Prevent Bugs:** Stop bad code from being deployed if tests fail.
- **Automate Releases:** Eliminate manual deployment steps, reducing human error.

## 2. Environment Limitations

**Note:** A CI/CD pipeline is an external process and **cannot be run or configured within the AI Studio environment**. This document serves as the official blueprint for when the project is moved to a standard development environment with version control (like Git and GitHub).

## 3. Example Blueprint (GitHub Actions)

This is a production-ready configuration file for GitHub Actions. In a real project, this code would be saved as `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

```yaml
# GitHub Actions Workflow for VersaCRM Deployment

name: Deploy VersaCRM to Production

# Triggers the workflow on pushes to the 'main' branch
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  test-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # 1. Check out the repository code
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # 2. Set up the Node.js environment
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20' # Use a specific LTS version of Node.js
          cache: 'npm' # Cache dependencies to speed up future builds

      # 3. Install project dependencies
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm install

      # 4. Run the test suite (using the Vitest framework we set up)
      # The --run flag tells Vitest to execute once and exit.
      - name: Run Tests
        run: npm test -- --run

      # 5. Build the application for production
      # This step would typically be `npm run build` with Vite or a similar bundler.
      # For this environment, we'll simulate it with a simple command.
      - name: Build Project
        run: echo "Simulating production build..." # In a real project: npm run build

      # 6. Deploy to a hosting service (e.g., Vercel, Netlify)
      # This step is highly dependent on the chosen provider.
      # The example below shows a generic deployment to Vercel.
      - name: Deploy to Vercel
        uses: amondnet/vercel-action@v25
        with:
          # These secrets would be configured in the GitHub repository settings
          vercel-token: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
          vercel-org-id: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_ORG_ID }}
          vercel-project-id: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_PROJECT_ID }}
          vercel-args: '--prod' # Deploy to the production environment
```

## 4. Next Steps in a Real Environment

1.  Move this project's code to a local development environment.
2.  Initialize a Git repository and push it to GitHub.
3.  Create the `.github/workflows/` directory.
4.  Save the YAML content above as `deploy.yml` inside that directory.
5.  Configure the required secrets (`VERCEL_TOKEN`, etc.) in the GitHub repository's "Settings" > "Secrets and variables" > "Actions" section.

Once this is done, every push to the `main` branch will automatically trigger this pipeline.
